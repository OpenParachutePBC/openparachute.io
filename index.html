        <!-- Problem/Vision -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>You have a thought while walking—something worth keeping—and by the time you pull out your phone, open the app, navigate to the right place... the thought has started slipping away.</p>
            <p>Voice memos in one app, typed notes in another, AI conversations that start fresh every time. No way to see it all together. No tool that actually knows you.</p>
            <p>We're building something different: <strong>instead of you learning the system, the system learns you.</strong></p>

            <h2>What We're Building</h2>

            <div class="product">
                <h3>Parachute Daily</h3>
                <p>Voice journaling that meets you where you actually think—on walks, in the car, away from the desk. Record freely, get AI reflections that help you go deeper, and receive personalized daily briefings based on what matters to you.</p>
                <p>Everything stays on your device. Your audio, your transcripts, your data. No server required.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="product">
                <h3>Parachute Pro</h3>
                <p>The full extended mind experience. Daily journaling plus Chat (an AI companion that knows your context) plus Vault (your searchable knowledge base). Connect to your own Parachute Computer for free, or use our hosted service.</p>
                <span class="status">In development</span>
            </div>

            <div class="product">
                <h3>Parachute Computer</h3>
                <p>Your personal AI server. Runs on your machine, your VPS, or a VM. Full sovereignty over your data. Powers Parachute Pro at no cost—you bring your own API keys, we provide the software.</p>
                <p>If you've used Claude Code, think of this as Claude Code for your whole life, not just your codebase.</p>

        <!-- Principles -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Principles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local-first.</strong> Your data lives on your devices in plain files. If we disappeared tomorrow, your notes would still be there, readable in any text editor.</li>
                <li><strong>Voice-first.</strong> Talking is often more natural than typing. We want to meet people where their thinking actually happens.</li>
                <li><strong>Open source as trust.</strong> The only way to deserve trust with personal thinking is transparency. You can see exactly what the software does.</li>
                <li><strong>AI as partner.</strong> The goal isn't to automate your thinking. It's to help you think more clearly, remember more completely, make connections you might have missed.</li>
            </ul>
