            <h2>What Is Parachute?</h2>
            <p>Parachute is an open-source personal AI platform that runs on your machine. It combines the power of Claude Code, the conversational depth of Claude.ai, and a personal knowledge system&mdash;all in one integrated experience that connects directly with your everyday thinking.</p>
            <p>Instead of scattered tools that forget you exist between sessions, Parachute builds a picture of who you are, what you're working on, and what matters to you. <strong>Instead of you learning the system, the system learns you.</strong></p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>

            <div class="product">
                <h3>Parachute Computer</h3>
                <p>Your personal AI server. Install it on your machine, a VPS, or a Raspberry Pi. It orchestrates AI agents with three tiers of trust, connects to Telegram and Discord, and keeps everything in your vault&mdash;plain files you own forever.</p>
                <p>If you've used Claude Code, think of this as Claude Code for your whole life, not just your codebase.</p>

            <div class="product">
                <h3>Parachute App</h3>
                <p>One app, three core views. <strong>Chat</strong> for AI conversations with full context. <strong>Daily</strong> for voice journaling&mdash;capture thoughts on walks, in the car, wherever you think. <strong>Brain</strong> to search your personal knowledge graph.</p>
                <p>Available on macOS, Android, and web. Daily works offline. Everything else connects to your Parachute Computer.</p>

        <!-- Principles -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Principles</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local-first.</strong> Your data lives on your devices in plain files. If we disappeared tomorrow, your notes would still be there, readable in any text editor.</li>
                <li><strong>Voice-first.</strong> Talking is often more natural than typing. We meet people where their thinking actually happens.</li>
                <li><strong>Open source as trust.</strong> The only way to deserve trust with personal thinking is transparency. You can see exactly what the software does.</li>
                <li><strong>AI as partner.</strong> The goal isn't to automate your thinking. It's to help you think more clearly, remember more completely, make connections you might have missed.</li>
            </ul>
